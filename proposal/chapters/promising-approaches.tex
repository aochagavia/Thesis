\subsection{Adding transformations}

The measurements described in the previous section focus only on the effect of a transformation. From this perspective, there is no distinction between a transformation that is tailored to our dataset and one that is applicable to a broader range of programs. Since the goal of this project is to improve Ask-Elle's normalization in the general case, it is crucial to avoid ad-hoc transformations. For this purpose, we only consider adding a transformation when it is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mentioned in the literature or;
    \item Recognized as general-purpose by a group of experts.
\end{itemize}

Improving strategy generation and normalization.

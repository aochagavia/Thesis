For each exercise, we are going to:

1. Perform program clustering and analyze the resulting data
1. Identify transformations that suit our acceptance criteria
1. Implement them in Ask-Elle
1. Analyze the improvements in program clustering, considering not only the current exercise but all of them
1. Write a brief report highlighting relevant details so we can resort to it when writing the thesis

Note that the amount of weeks allocated to each exercise decreases as we advance, since we expect to build upon our previous work. Additionally, extra time is allocated to exercise 1, as it involves fixing some bugs, like that `double xs = map (* 2) xs` is not recognized as equivalent to `double = map (* 2)`.

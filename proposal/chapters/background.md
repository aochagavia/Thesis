Question: how long should this section be? In most projects, the proposal consists mainly of a literature study, so I guess this is an important section. On the other hand, I have jumped directly into Ask-Elle, analyzing stuff without looking around. I assume this section can be brief, then.

NOTE: see articles referenced by Alex in the Ask-Elle paper we cited.

Style-related feedback: HLint (difference: we can lint incomplete programs!)

What else do we need to reference? Tree rewriting?

Do we need to mention IDEAS?

The `aggressive` and `baseline` directories contain data about the clusters generated before this research (baseline) and those generated after our changes, using the aggressive normalization strategy (aggressive).

Both directories contain a file for each of the exercises. Such file consists of student numbers (one per line) separated by newlines. Adjacent student numbers correspond to programs that normalize to the same cluster. Blank lines represent the end of a cluster and the beginning of the next one.

\chapter{Adding new transformations}
\label{sec:improvements}

Here I will answer the second research question, to some extent, by explaining the approach we took to improve normalization. This is not a direct improvement on Ask-Elle's feedback, but is a step in the right direction.

\section{New transformations}

Lorem ipsum

% % Abstract vs apply function
% % Fusion laws and other laws

% Transformations to address style and normalization issues. Note that not all issues could be addressed!

% Avoid ad-hoc transformations, keep it as general as possible.

% Details of each transformation are somewhere (in their own chapter?). Refer to Appendix \ref{app:transformations} for a comprehensive overview of the new transformations.

\section{Improvements}

After implementing the aforementioned transformations, we measured the effectiveness of the new normalization strategy. Below is a comparison between the original version of Ask-Elle and a new version that uses our transformations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercise 1: from 85.5\% with 3 model solutions to 99.1\% with 1 model solution.
    \item Exercise 2: from 36\% with 5 model solutions to 80.2\% with 5 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 3: from 54.4\% with 4 model solutions to 85.4\% with 3 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 4: from 61.1\% with 5 model solutions to 90.7\% with 3 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 5: from 45\% with 4 model solutions to 96.4\% with 2 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 6: from 7.9\% with 4 model solutions to 86.1\% with 2 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 7: from 14.1\% with 5 model solutions to 74.7\% with 5 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 8: from 23.2\% with 5 model solutions to 87.9\% with 5 model solutions.
\end{itemize}

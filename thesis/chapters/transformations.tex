After implementing the transformations, we measured the effectiveness of the new normalization strategy. Below is a comparison between the original version of Ask-Elle and a new version that uses our transformations:

Pie charts!

\section{Solution coverage}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercise 1: from 85.5\% with 3 model solutions to 99.1\% with 1 model solution.
    \item Exercise 2: from 36\% with 5 model solutions to 80.2\% with 5 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 3: from 54.4\% with 4 model solutions to 85.4\% with 3 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 4: from 61.1\% with 5 model solutions to 90.7\% with 3 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 5: from 45\% with 4 model solutions to 96.4\% with 2 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 6: from 7.9\% with 4 model solutions to 86.1\% with 2 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 7: from 14.1\% with 5 model solutions to 74.7\% with 5 model solutions.
    \item Exercise 8: from 23.2\% with 5 model solutions to 87.9\% with 5 model solutions.
\end{itemize}

% Everything is great!

% Question: what is the impact of our new transformations on the ability to provide hints? No easy way to test, though... Is there? Maybe Alejandro has ideas?

% Note: talk about the possibility of unifying full programs instead of relying on a custom normalization algorithm (this is already mentioned in Future Work)

% Talk about the difference between aggressive and conservative

% Bias towards finding lots of stuff about lists, not so much about other things (booleans, Maybe)

% Precondition-aware normalization?

\section{Precondition-aware normalization}
\label{sec:discussion-preconditions}

Program slicing: removing pieces based on gathered knowledge. Not only usable for preconditions!
